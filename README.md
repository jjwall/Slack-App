# Slack-App
A simple and free slack app built with Firebase's Realtime Database API, Node, Express, jQuery and Bulma.io.
Type in your name and click submit or hit enter to get started.

Right now it's a real time messaging app in a single message space, but I still want to:
- Make the option for users to create their own message space
- Enable users to share unique message spaces with others in a secure way
- Utilize MongoDB to save past messages
- Integrate User Authentication
